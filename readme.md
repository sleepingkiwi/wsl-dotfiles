# my wip dotfiles for wsl

## `.nanorc`

adding syntax highlighting to make quick edits easier

## `.bashrc and .bash_sleepingkiwi`

customising bash, adding aliases, defining colours etc.

all custom stuff is kept in .bash_sleepingkiwi and just imported into .bashrc because tons of other programs want to be editing .bashrc all the time and it gets noisy in there.

## `.inputrc`

customisations to _READLINE_, autocomplete settings mainly.
