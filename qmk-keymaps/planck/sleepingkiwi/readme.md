- extra nav layer for media control and arrows on `I`, `J`, `K`, & `L`
  - triggered by holding tab
- rotary encoder that scrolls on QWERTY or controls volume on RAISE/LOWER
- triple tap brackets on the bottom row for easy `([{}])`
- adjusted mods and bottom row keys to be more useful to me

`qmk compile -kb planck/rev6 -km sleepingkiwi`
